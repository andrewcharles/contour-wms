This file lists the dependencies for this application, as well as describes
how to install these dependencies on CentOS 5. Scripts are provided to
automate these tasks on CentOS 5. This was not tested for Linux distributions,
but should work for RHEL 5 as well.

Dependencies:
=============

    from Package Manager:
    =====================

        * zlib 
        * udunits2-devel
        * curl-devel
        * freetype-devel
        * libpng-devel
        * blas-devel
        * lapack-devel
        * atlas
        * gcc-gfortran
        * tk-devel
        * 'Development Tools'

        optional:
        ---------

        * git

    installed by Hand:
    ==================

    * Python 2.7.x
    * numpy
    * scipy
    * basemap
    * matplotlib
    * flask

Installation in CentOS 5.6:
===========================

    * Source files will be downloaded to /usr/local/src.

    1 .Preparations
    ===============

First, we will make sure that all the things we need to install our software
are installed on the system.

    * https://github.com/victornava/bom-mapping/blob/master/playground/stefan/scripts/00_install_general_utils.sh

This script takes care of a couple of settings, and installs the dependencies
that come with CentOS. The script is commented, so just select the functions
that you need to run. If all the dependencies are there already, go to the
next step.


    2. Python 2.7
    =============

The next step is to install the latest Python 2.x version. In our case, we will
install Python 2.7.2. The script that will do that for you can be found under

    * https://github.com/victornava/bom-mapping/blob/master/playground/stefan/scripts/05_install_python_2.7_src.sh

This downloads, compiles and installs PYthon 2.7.2 into /usr/local, and updates
the linker. This is necessary for the next step, when we compile mod_wsgi
against this Python version.


    3. mod_wsgi
    ===========

Now we'll install mod_wsgi 3.3, compile it against the new version of Python.
The script that does that for you can be found here:

    * https://github.com/victornava/bom-mapping/blob/master/playground/stefan/scripts/10_install_mod_wsgi_src.sh


    4. Dependencies for Prototype
    =============================

The are the dependencies that need to be installed in order for the prototype
to work. I am not sure, but since we are using a newer version of Python, it
might be a good idea to start from scratch installing the dependencies. Scripts
that help re provided here:

    * https://github.com/victornava/bom-mapping/blob/master/playground/stefan/scripts/15_install_prototype_dependencies.sh

    5. Dependencies for new Application
    ===================================

The last step is to install the additional dependencies for the new application,
and to downloaded the lateat version from trunk into the current users home
directory. This script will help you with that:

    * https://github.com/victornava/bom-mapping/blob/master/playground/stefan/scripts/25_install_bom_dependencies.sh

    6. Pydap server (optional)
    ==========================

If you want to run a pydap server locally, do the following:

    * cd
    * paster create -t pydap myserver
    * paster serve ./myserver/server.ini &
